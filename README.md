# Notes App

This is a simple Notes application built with **Node.js** and **React.js**. The project demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via an API, using technologies like **TypeScript**, **Prisma**, and **Express.js**.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for notes.
- RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- **React.js** frontend for interacting with the API.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and code quality.
- **Prisma** for database management and ORM.
- Integration of **Prisma** migrations and schema management.
- Fully functional backend and frontend with a simple interface for note management.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the API.
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript for type-safe code.
- **Prisma**: ORM for interacting with the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database (depending on your Prisma configuration).
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the API.
